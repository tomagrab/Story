I have become something. Before in my middle parts I thought of myself little more than nothing, yet here I stand: a something.
A something to a someone. Funny, she thinks of herself lower than I, yet to my eyes she is everything.
When I look into her eyes the feeling I have for her reflects back to myself and I realize how selfish I have been.
