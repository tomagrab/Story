	In the begging, I was nothing. During the middle, I am a little more than nothing. At the end, I hope to be something. What am I? It's a silly question; meant for myself and not you. Of course, how could I honestly ask you anything? I will never know your name or see your face. To me, you are less than me. Absolute zero - nothing. And I do not mean that to be derogatory; you are honestly nothingness to me. When I say "you", I suppose I am whispering to the wind, wondering if she hears my imagination.
